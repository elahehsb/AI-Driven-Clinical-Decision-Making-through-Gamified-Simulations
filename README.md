# AI-Driven Clinical Decision-Making through Gamified Simulations

### Overview
This project aims to develop a gamified platform that simulates clinical emergencies using virtual patients and educational escape room elements. The platform will collect multimodal data from physiological sensors, questionnaires, and digital logs. The analysis of this data will employ temporal learning analytics and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to map the clinical reasoning process and identify key factors for effective decision-making.

### Technologies and Tools
  ###### Front-end: React.js
  ###### Back-end: Node.js, Express.js
  ###### Database: MongoDB
  ###### Data Collection: Physiological sensors (e.g., heart rate monitors), SurveyJS for questionnaires, digital logging via platform interactions
  ###### Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy), Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, SHAP for XAI
  ###### Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes
  ###### Version Control: Git, GitHub
### Architecture
###### User Interface: A web-based interface for interaction with the platform.
###### Data Collection: Integration of physiological sensors and implementation of questionnaires.
###### Data Storage: A NoSQL database to store collected data.
###### Data Analysis: Scripts and models for data analysis and XAI.
###### Backend API: RESTful API for communication between the front-end and back-end.
